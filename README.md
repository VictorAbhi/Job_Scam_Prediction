# üöÄ Fake Job Posting Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts fraudulent job postings. Using various classification algorithms and data preprocessing techniques, the model identifies scams in job listings based on structured features. Aiming for Deep Learning after finishing machine learning tasks. Resuming project on April 8th 2025 after long gap due to examination.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of job postings with labels indicating whether the job is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0). It contains structured attributes such as job title, company profile, location, salary range, and job description. 

**Key Challenges:**
- Highly imbalanced dataset (few fraudulent jobs compared to legitimate ones)
- Presence of textual data requiring feature engineering
- Need for careful handling of false negatives (missing fraudulent jobs)

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Checked class distribution and feature importance
- Visualized missing values and handled them appropriately

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing**
- Removed unnecessary text preprocessing to avoid information loss
- Applied **TF-IDF** vectorization for text features (if applicable)
- Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE and Hybrid Sampling**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) ‚Äì Best Performing Model**


#NOTE: THE PROJECT IS TERMINATED DUE TO HEAVILY IMBALANCE DATASET.
